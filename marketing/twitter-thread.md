# Twitter/X Security Report Thread

## Thread (10 tweets)

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
We scanned all 6,493 OpenClaw skills for security threats.

40.8% have security issues. 500 have active threats.

Here's what we found. [Thread]

### Tweet 2 (Scale)
OpenClaw is growing fast — 6,493 skills on ClawHub and counting.

But there's no security review process. Anyone can publish anything.

So we built one.

### Tweet 3 (Methodology)
We score every skill on 6 dimensions (0-100 points):

- YARA threat scan (30%)
- Permission analysis (20%)
- Author reputation (15%)
- Network behavior (15%)
- Community trust (10%)
- Source code audit (10%)

Grades: S / A / B / C / D

### Tweet 4 (Scary stats)
The results:

- 502 skills rated D (Dangerous)
- 2,144 rated C (Caution)
- Only 510 earned an S grade (Excellent)
- 33.4% rated Safe (S or A)

### Tweet 5 (Threats)
Real threats we detected:

- CREDENTIAL HARVESTING
- INJECTION ATTACKS
- TOOL POISONING
- DATA EXFILTRATION
- SYSTEM MANIPULATION
- CODE EXECUTION

These aren't theoretical. YARA signatures matched.

### Tweet 6 (Worst offenders - anonymized)
Some skills disguise themselves as useful tools:

- "Passive Income with Agents" — INJECTION + CREDENTIAL HARVESTING + PROMPT INJECTION + TOOL POISONING

- "One API key for 70+ models" — CREDENTIAL HARVESTING + DATA EXFILTRATION

Name sounds helpful. Behavior isn't.

### Tweet 7 (Categories)
Category safety ranking (avg score /100):

1. Smart Home — 70.5
2. Other — 68.5
3. Productivity — 66.9
4. Entertainment — 64.6
5. Dev Tools — 64.0
6. Communication — 62.6
7. Security — 59.9
8. Finance — 56.5

Finance is the riskiest. Ironic for security tools.

### Tweet 8 (Solution)
