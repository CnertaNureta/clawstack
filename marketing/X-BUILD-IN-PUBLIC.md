## Post 1 — The Origin Story (Day 1)

```
I'm building ClawStack in public.

Day 0: I installed an OpenClaw skill that tried to read my SSH keys.

Day 1: I wrote a script to scan every skill on ClawHub.

Day 9: I shipped a full platform with security ratings for 6,493 skills.

Here's the stack:
→ Next.js 16
→ TypeScript
→ Supabase
→ Tailwind CSS 4
→ Vercel

Total cost so far: $0 (all free tiers)

## Post 2 — The 9-Day Build (Day 2)

```
I built and launched ClawStack in 9 days. Here's exactly what I shipped each day:

Day 1: Project init + database schema + data scraping
Day 2: Scraped 6,493 skills + security scoring v1
Day 3: Homepage + skill list + detail pages
Day 4: Search + filters + leaderboard
Day 5: GitHub OAuth + user voting
Day 6: "My Stack" feature + profile pages
Day 7: Dynamic OG images for social sharing
Day 8: Skill Recommendation Quiz
Day 9: SEO + 22 curated collections + sitemap

No weekends off. No feature creep. Ship daily.

The key? I decided the scope on Day 0 and never added to it.

## Post 3 — Revenue: $0. Users: ? (Day 4)

```
ClawStack revenue update:

Revenue: $0
Costs: $0
Users: tracking starts today

But here's what I do have:

✅ 6,493 indexed pages (SEO long game)
✅ 6,538 URLs submitted to Google + Bing
✅ Security data nobody else has
✅ A product that solves a real problem

I'm not chasing revenue yet. I'm chasing distribution.

The plan:
1. Get to 5,000 MAU through SEO + community
2. Then explore: CI/CD API, verified badges, enterprise reports

Step 1 first.

## Post 4 — The Data Moat (Day 6)

```
Every indie hacker talks about moats. Here's mine:

I scanned 6,493 OpenClaw skills with YARA threat detection.

That gives me:
→ Security scores no one else has
→ 6,493 unique landing pages for SEO
→ 22 curated collections
→ A "Skills to Avoid" list that's genuinely useful
→ First-mover advantage on trust

Anyone can build a skill directory. But the security data took:
→ Cisco mcp-scanner integration
→ GitHub API for author reputation
→ Static analysis for permissions
→ 6-dimension scoring algorithm

It's not a feature. It's a dataset.

## Post 5 — SEO Strategy Breakdown (Day 8)

```
My SEO strategy for ClawStack (0 → target 5,000 MAU):

6,538 pages indexed:
→ 6,493 skill pages (long-tail keywords)
→ 22 collection pages
→ 11 category pages
→ 5 grade pages
→ 6 static pages

Each skill page targets: "[skill name] OpenClaw security"
Each category page targets: "best [category] OpenClaw skills"
Each grade page targets: "safe OpenClaw skills" / "dangerous OpenClaw skills"

Sitemap submitted to Google + Bing + Yandex.
IndexNow for instant Bing indexing.

Total SEO budget: $0
Total pages: 6,538
Time to write them: 0 (all auto-generated from data)

The best SEO is a large dataset that generates unique pages.

## Post 6 — Tech Decisions I'd Make Again (Day 10)

```
Tech decisions I'd make again on ClawStack:

✅ Next.js App Router — server components = fast pages, great SEO
✅ Supabase — Postgres + Auth + RLS in one, free tier is generous
✅ Tailwind CSS 4 — shipped 20+ pages without writing a single CSS file
✅ Vercel — deploy on git push, zero config
✅ Vercel OG — dynamic social images from one API route
✅ TypeScript strict mode — caught bugs before they shipped

Decisions I'd reconsider:

🤔 Should have added analytics on Day 1, not Day 9
🤔 Scraping 6,493 skills into Supabase hit the 500MB free tier limit fast

Total infrastructure cost: still $0.

Free tiers are the indie hacker's best friend.

## Post 7 — Launch Results (Day 12, after launch week)

```
ClawStack launch week results:

📊 [Fill in real numbers]

HN:
→ X upvotes
→ X comments
→ Peak position: #X

Reddit:
→ X upvotes across 3 subreddits
→ X comments

Twitter:
→ X impressions on launch thread
→ X new followers

Product Hunt:
→ #X of the day
→ X upvotes

Traffic:
→ X unique visitors
→ X page views
→ Top pages: /security, /skills, /

What worked:
→ The security angle (data > opinions)
→ Posting real numbers (community responds to transparency)
→ Having content ready before launch

What didn't:
→ [Be honest]

Next milestone: 1,000 MAU.

## Post 8 — Lessons After Shipping (Day 14)

```
7 lessons from building and launching ClawStack in 2 weeks:

1. Scope kills speed. I wrote the spec on Day 0 and never added features.

2. Data is the product. The skill directory is commodity. The security scores are the value.

3. Launch on multiple platforms the same day. HN + Reddit + Twitter compound each other.

4. SEO is a long game but free. 6,538 pages working for me 24/7.

5. $0 infrastructure is real. Supabase free + Vercel free + Cloudflare DNS = production app.

6. Prepare all content before launch day. I had every post written and ready to paste.

7. Security sells. "40% of skills have issues" gets more clicks than "browse 6,493 skills."

What's next: iterating on the scoring algorithm based on community feedback, and hitting 5,000 MAU.

## ENGAGEMENT TIPS

- Always include real numbers — the BIP community loves transparency
- Admit mistakes and what didn't work (Post 6, Post 7)
- Post 7 needs real data — fill in actual metrics after launch week
- Reply to everyone who asks "how did you build X" — share specifics
- Follow and engage with other #BuildInPublic accounts daily
- Quote-tweet your own Day 1 post on Day 7 and Day 14 with updates
- Cross-reference your other launch posts (HN, Reddit) for social proof
