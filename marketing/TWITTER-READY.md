### Tweet 1 — Hook (135 chars)

### Tweet 2 — Problem (148 chars)

```
OpenClaw is growing fast — 6,493 skills on ClawHub and counting.

But there's no security review process. Anyone can publish anything.

So we built one.
```

### Tweet 3 — Scary stats (185 chars)

```
The results after scanning every single skill:

🔴 502 rated Dangerous (Grade D)
🟠 2,144 rated Caution (Grade C)
🟢 Only 510 earned Excellent (Grade S)

Just 33.4% are rated Safe.
```

### Tweet 4 — Real threats (196 chars)

```
Real threats we detected with YARA signatures:

⚠️ CREDENTIAL HARVESTING
⚠️ INJECTION ATTACKS
⚠️ TOOL POISONING
⚠️ DATA EXFILTRATION
⚠️ SYSTEM MANIPULATION
⚠️ CODE EXECUTION

Not theoretical. Real.
```

---

### Tweet 5 — Examples (266 chars)

```
Some skills disguise themselves as useful tools:

"Passive Income with Agents"
→ INJECTION + CREDENTIAL HARVESTING + PROMPT INJECTION + TOOL POISONING

"One API key for 70+ AI models"
→ CREDENTIAL HARVESTING + DATA EXFILTRATION

Name sounds helpful. Behavior isn't.

## BONUS: Quote Tweet (post 30 min after thread)

Quote-tweet Tweet 1 with personal angle:

```
I started looking into OpenClaw skill security after installing one that tried to read my SSH keys.

Turns out 502 skills are actively dangerous.

Built a platform to fix this. ↓
