# Product Hunt Launch

## Tagline (60 chars max)
The trusted way to discover safe OpenClaw skills

## Description (260 chars max)
ClawStack scans 6,493 OpenClaw skills for security threats. Every skill gets a 0-100 score across 6 dimensions — from YARA threat detection to author reputation. Browse safely, filter by grade, and share your stack.

## Full Description

### Problem
OpenClaw has 6,400+ skills — but no security review process. Anyone can publish anything. Our scan found 502 dangerous skills and 500 with active threats like credential harvesting and injection attacks.

### Solution
ClawStack gives every skill a security grade (S/A/B/C/D) based on 6-dimensional analysis:

1. YARA threat scanning (Cisco mcp-scanner)
2. Permission analysis (shell, file, network access)
3. Author GitHub reputation
4. External network behavior
5. Community trust voting
6. Source code availability

### Key Features
- Browse 6,493 skills with security ratings
- Filter by grade, category, trending
- 22 curated collections (Safest Skills, Skills to Avoid, etc.)
- My Stack — share what you use at clawstack.dev/@you
- Skill Recommendation Quiz
- Full security report with methodology

### Built With
Next.js 16, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind CSS 4, Vercel

## Maker's Comment (First Comment)

Hey Product Hunt!

I built ClawStack after a simple question: how do you know which OpenClaw skills are safe to install?

The answer was: you don't. There's no review process on ClawHub, no security ratings, no way to tell a legitimate tool from a credential harvester.

So I scanned all 6,493 skills using Cisco's YARA-based threat detection engine.

The results were alarming — 40.8% flagged with security concerns, 500 with active threats.

ClawStack is my answer: a trust-first discovery platform where every skill has a security grade, and you can see exactly why.

I'd love your feedback on:
- The scoring methodology (is 6 dimensions the right approach?)
- The UX for communicating risk without causing panic
- What features would make you come back daily?

Thanks for checking it out!
